General Rules:

Be respectful to all players.
Use common sense. If you are confused about a rule, please ask a staff member or use your best discretion.
Two wrongs don’t make a right. If you need help with a rule breaker, contact a staff member, don’t try to take the matter into your own hands.
Do not discriminate, harass, or direct unnecessarily foul language towards any other players.
Do not spam voice/mic chat. Do not use OOC, admin chat, or the ticket system for reasons other than their intended uses.
Do not camera spam.
Do not impersonate staff members.
Your nickname (/rpname) must be at least four standard english characters in a row, and may not be similar to any other player’s name.
Any threats or intent to harm other players, or the server itself, will result in a ban.
Do not complain about staffing decisions in game or in OOC chat.
Avoiding punishment by a staff member, through any means, is forbidden.
If you believe a staff member’s decision is either grossly unjust or doesn’t make sense, please use the forums to file a staff report.
You are not exempt from rules if you break them to your friends. (you cannot kill your friends because they “don’t care”)
Do not use cheats or exploits.
Do not vote to kick other players (!votekick) if a staff member is online. If a staff member is online but away, you may votekick.
You may not spam-knock on doors.
Do not roleplay in spawn.
Any player who reaches 50 !warns will be banned from the server for one week. Any player who reaches 75 !warns (an additional 25 after their first ban has elapsed) will be banned for two weeks. Players with 100 !warns will be banned for three weeks, and players with 125 !warns will be banned for a whole month, after which time their !warns will be reduced to 75.
If you share a Steam or Garry’s Mod account, you accept the possibility that your account may be banned even if the person who broke the rules was not yourself.
Do not advertise for other communities.
Do not interfere with staff members or sits.
Multi-binds (“/advert Kidnap/Raid/PD Raid/ Mug”) are not permitted. Each action requires a separate message.
Do not report players without legitimate, valid reason.
Do not waste a staff member’s time!
Staff members reserve the right to use their best judgement when dealing with infractions not mentioned in the MOTD. Do not question their authority.
Roleplay Rules:

Random Deathmatch (RDM)
Players directly harming your life, property, and/or freedom may be killed without warning.
Raids and hits can be completed by killing without warning (provided “Raid” and “Hit Accepted” have been averted beforehand).
In all other cases, before killing a player you must perform three warning adverts (“Warn 1,” “Warn 2,” “Warn 3”), and make it clear to the player in question why you are warning them. You may only warn players if you have real in-character reason for doing so.
If a player is warning you, you do not have the right to kill them unless they shoot at you.
Randomly shooting at cars is considered Attempted RDM (ARDM).
Metagaming and New Life Rule (NLR)
Your character may not use information beyond their knowledge (no player may act based on someone’s class, name, etc.).
Characters must have a real and valid in-character reason behind their actions.
New Life Rule lasts for three minutes. So, a player may not return to the site of their death for three minutes after the fact. Also, if a player is killed during a raid, they must wait until that raid is completed (when the attackers advert “Raid Over”) to return to the site of their death.
Players may not remember any aspect of their former life after death.
Don’t hide inside cars to avoid combat.
Props and Entities
Prop abuse, such as prop surfing, prop spamming, etc., is not allowed.
Never spawn props inside of other players’ bases without permission.
Players cannot take entities that other players won through a raid during the process of moving them.
Abnormally large bases, obscene objects, or structures which block the road will be removed.
Don’t vape over chess or checkers tables.
All of your props must be indoors, within the walls/fences of your property, or on a roof which you yourself own (except for Hobos).
The use of World Glow on props is not allowed.
Translucent props are fully acceptable; transparent props are not allowed.
models/wireframe is not allowed.
models/effects/vol_light001 is not allowed.
models/screenspace is not allowed.
Basing and Building
While building, players should put a “Building” sign in a visible area outside of their base.
When a base is building, it is un-attackable, but it may not contain any entities.
A player must be able to enter and exit all parts of your base using a lockpick.
Bases may have no more than three fading doors (including windows) total.
All keypads must be easily visible, and connected to a working fading door.
Keypads must open their respective doors for at least 5 seconds with no delay.
Bases cannot force players to crouch or jump in order to enter.
Fading bridges and sky-bases are not allowed.
Do not build on the streets.
Bases which contain mazes, blackout rooms, and other disorienting, unfair advantages will be removed.
KOS (kill on sight) lines are permitted.
You may only own one base at a time!
Your base may not contain any small cracks (headshot/footshot traps) designed to give you an advantage in combat, crouch-tunnels, or jump barriers.
Never shoot through any prop.
Don’t shoot through translucent or opaque props.
You may shoot through un-materialized fences props.
You may shoot through windows and doors that are part of the map, but not walls.
You may have fading windows which are controlled by non-toggle, hold-down buttons (these count towards your three fading door limit).
Only up to six people may inhabit any single base together.
To megabase, seek an Admin’s approval.
Megabases must follow all normal building rules (they may have three fading doors per building, plus two for a font gate, as opposed to the usual three total).
Each building within any given megabase must be owned by a different player.
You may not megabase in Suburbs.
RP Relations
You are free to protect players that you have RP Relation with (the first rule of RDM extends to these people, so you may defend them from attacks).
There are three ways to be RP Related:
Team: Members of the same team (mafia or terrorist) may defend one another, but they must advert “Counter” before doing so.
Customer Relationship: For merchants, whilst engaging in a transaction, you have RP Relation with your customer. You must advert “Counter” to defend them if they are attacked during a deal.
Party: If players are in a party (!party) together, and are of an appropriate class (Merchants, Thieves, Terrorists, or Mafia), they may defend one another without advert.
Raiding/Mugging/Kidnapping
Raiding, mugging, carjacking, kidnapping, stealing, and any other hostile/aggressive action towards another player is called an “attack”.
Players must wait 5 minutes (from the end of one to the beginning of the next) between executing two of the same attacks.
Players may not re-raid the same base, re-mug, or re-kidnap the same person for 10 minutes after said attack ends.
Only players who are owners of a base (their name is on the doors) may defend said base from a raid.
Players have the right to fight back against mugs.
Players may only defend themselves if there is just one player that is pursuing them. You may not defend yourself if you are outgunned.
Players can always defend themselves against kidnappings (there is no FearRP on this server).
Players must advert before performing any attack!
Assisting raiders must advert “Raid Assist”.
Only players with RP Relation may assist in raids.
Before a player takes anything from another player without their permission, they must advert “Steal” or “Theft”.
To raid the PD, players must advert “PD Raid”.
In kidnaps, hostages may be held for a maximum of 10 minutes.
Kidnappers are not required to accept ransom payments.
Kidnap ransom cannot exceed $10,000.
Mugging amounts cannot exceed $2,500.
If the owner of a carjacked vehicle offers to buy it back, they must be allowed to.
Cars may only be ransomed for up to $20,000.
You may not build during a raid.
If you’re raiding a base, anyone inside can be KOS.
Government classes can defend themselves and others from all attacks without advert.
Only the police, SWAT, and mayor can defend from a PD Raid. Criminal classes must work together to attack the PD (they may not attack one another, and criminals may not counter a PD Raid).
If someone tries to free a hostage, the kidnapper may defend their prisoner.
Players may not attack members of their own team (Mafia and Terrorist).
When mugging, give the player at least 10 seconds to comply before killing them.
Classes that carry guns by default always have the right to shoot back when getting mugged, no matter how many people are attacking them.
If the player you’re mugging runs, you have right to kill them.
Once you’ve completed your raid, you must leave immediately, and you must advert “Raid Over”. You cannot occupy players’ bases.
If it is obvious that the base you are raiding is either abandoned, has no entities, or is unowned, you may not raid it.
Job Rules

(If a class does not state your ability to own entities, then you are allowed.)
